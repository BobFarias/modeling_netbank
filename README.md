# Netbank Application

This is the modeling implementation of a netbank application written in Typescript. The purpose of this exercise was to define and model the complex state of the application using a single value, composed of various types, to represent all possible states and combinations.

## Implementation

The implementation of the complex type for the application state is aligned with the requirements. By carefully defining the type and utilizing helper types, the aim is to express all the possible states while ensuring that undesired states and combinations are disallowed or minimized.

By addressing the challenge and carefully defining the complex type for the application state, this solution demonstrates my problem-solving skills and the ability to compose types effectively.
